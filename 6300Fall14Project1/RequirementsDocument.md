**Requirements Document**

1 User Requirements
  1.1 Software Interfaces

Software will take as input the raw text files of students' essays.  Software will process text file and return average length of each sentence.

List all the external systems with which the software product interacts. These are external systems/libraries that you have to interact with.

  1.2 User Interfaces

User will provide the file path of their essay as a command line argument for software.  Additionally, users may specify delimiters for what constitutes a sentence separator as well as the lower limit of the word length for the program.  Otherwise, default settings will be used. 

Specify the logical characteristics of each interface between the software product and its users. This is a description of how the system will interact with its users.

  1.3 User Characteristics

Typical user will be of university level (undergraduate to graduate).  The degree of technical experience will vary from novice to high level proficiency.  Likewise, the operating systems and computer specifications used by the students will be variable as well.  

Describe those general characteristics of the intended users of the product, including educational level, experience, and technical expertise.

2 System Requirements

These subsections contain all the software requirements at a level of detail sufficient to enable designers/developers to design/develop a system that satisfies those requirements, and testers to test that the system satisfies those requirements. This part of the document should provide a numbered (possibly hierarchical) list of simple, complete, and consistent functional and non-functional requirements.
 
  2.1 Functional Requirements
  
  2.2 Non-Functional Requirements
