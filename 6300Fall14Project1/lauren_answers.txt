1.  Do you consider files from programs like Microsoft Word as "raw text files" or just files like those found in notepad?
We would consider all kinds of files as .txt files
2.  Will students be submitting a title page with their essays that includes things like their name, the date, the title, etc.?
The students could submit anything. We would like you to process them anyway.
