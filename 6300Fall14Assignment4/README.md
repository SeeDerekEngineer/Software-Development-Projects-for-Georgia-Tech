This is a simple Android App to convert to and from:
  1. Miles and Kilometers
  2. Square Feet and Square Meters
  3. US Dollars and Euros
  
To use, simply enter the value you wish to convert in one of the three fields.  Then, hit the button 
corresponding to the value you wish to obtain (i.e., to obtain how many kilometers are in 1 mile, enter '1', then hit
the 'Kilometers' button).  Hitting the same button multiple times in a row will perform the conversion with each press, using the previously generated answer as the new input.

If there is no number before a conversion button is pressed, the app will remind the user to enter a valid number prior to hitting a conversion button.
