This is a simple Android App to convert to and from:
  1. Miles and Kilometers
  2. Square Feet and Square Meters
  3. US Dollars and Euros
  
To use, simply delete the default value of '0.0' from the text field and enter the value you wish to convert.  Then, hit the button 
corresponding to the value you wish to obtain (i.e., to obtain how many kilometers are in 1 mile, delete '0.0', enter '1', then hit
the 'Kilometers' button).  Hitting the same button twice will perform the conversion again.

Ensure there is a value in the text field before hitting a button, as failing to do so will cause the application to crash.
